A personal portfolio is more than a resume—it is a playground for experimentation. It is a space where I can test ideas, showcase what I am building, and express my personal design sensibilities.

Drawing inspiration from my hobby of bullet journaling, I designed the site using a bento-style grid that mirrors how I structure and organize a physical journal page. This approach allowed me to combine visual hierarchy with flexibility and intentional whitespace.

I began by wireframing the experience in Figma, focusing on reusable components and responsive behavior across desktop and mobile. Using Figma Make, I generated an initial code draft from the wireframes, which served as a helpful starting point but required significant refinement. I addressed issues with Tailwind implementation, text overflow responsiveness, and inconsistent spacing, then iteratively improved the site using Cursor to accelerate development and polish interactions.

Building **ellalloyd.xyz 2.0** strengthened my end-to-end design-to-development workflow, sharpened my Figma skills, and pushed me to work more efficiently while exploring a more creative, personal visual direction.
